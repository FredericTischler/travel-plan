# travel-service

**Context:** Destinations (Spring Boot · Neo4j).

## Current scope

Increment 1: basic CRUD for a single node type, `Destination`.
Increment 2: a first, directed relationship type, `TRANSPORT`, between two
`Destination` nodes, and the project's first real graph traversal query.

- `POST /destinations` — create a new destination (`name`, `country`).
- `GET /destinations/{id}` — get an active destination by id (404 if absent
  or soft-deleted).
- `GET /destinations` — list all active destinations.
- `PUT /destinations/{id}` — replace the mutable fields (`name`, `country`)
  of an active destination (404 if absent or soft-deleted).
- `DELETE /destinations/{id}` — soft-delete an active destination (404 if
  absent or already soft-deleted).
- `POST /destinations/{fromId}/transports` — create a directed `TRANSPORT`
  relationship from `fromId` to `toDestinationId` (body: `toDestinationId`,
  `mode`, `durationMinutes`). 201 if both endpoints exist and are active; 400
  if `fromId == toDestinationId`, `mode` is not one of `TRAIN`/`PLANE`/`BUS`/
  `CAR`/`BOAT`, or `durationMinutes <= 0`; 404 if origin or target is
  absent/soft-deleted.
- `GET /destinations/{id}/transports` — one-hop traversal: destinations
  reachable from `id` via an outgoing `TRANSPORT` relationship. Filters
  `deletedAt IS NULL` at both hops (origin and target), so a soft-deleted
  target disappears from the result without its relationship being removed
  from the graph. 404 if `id` itself is absent/soft-deleted.

`Destination.id` is application-assigned (a plain UUID), not Neo4j's
internal (opaque) element id.

## TRANSPORT relationship — deliberate simplifications (increment 2)

- **Directed, non-symmetric**: `A-[TRANSPORT]->B` does not imply
  `B-[TRANSPORT]->A`; if both exist they are two distinct relationships.
- **No anti-duplicate protection**: creating the same `A->B` trip twice is
  not blocked. This is an accepted, documented gap for this increment, not
  an oversight — see the Javadoc on `TransportRepository`.
- **Single hop only**: no pathfinding, no multi-hop/recursive traversal, no
  second node type. `GET /destinations/{id}/transports` returns exactly the
  destinations one `TRANSPORT` edge away.
- **No update/delete on transports**: once created, a `TRANSPORT`
  relationship cannot be modified or removed through the API in this
  increment.
- **Bypasses the standard Spring Data Neo4j aggregate save/load flow**: the
  `Destination` entity does declare `@Relationship(type = "TRANSPORT", ...)`
  (documenting the domain model), but both creation and traversal are
  implemented with explicit Cypher via `Neo4jClient` in
  `TransportRepository`, not via `destinationRepository.save(...)`. SDN
  persists a `@Relationship` collection by deleting every existing
  relationship of that type from a node and recreating it from the
  in-memory list on every `save()` — combined with "no anti-duplicate
  protection" (so several relationships of the same type may legitimately
  coexist from one origin), a load-modify-save flow on a
  partially-fetched aggregate could silently wipe sibling relationships it
  never loaded. Explicit Cypher avoids that risk entirely.

## Soft-delete

Nodes are never physically removed. "Delete" sets `deletedAt` on the node to
the current timestamp; the node stays. Every read Cypher query
(`findActiveById`, `findAllActive`) systematically filters on
`d.deletedAt IS NULL`, so a soft-deleted destination is indistinguishable
from a non-existent one to API callers — same foundation as `User`/`Payment`
in identity-service/payment-service.

## Schema constraint at startup

There is no Flyway (or equivalent migration tool) for this service. Instead,
`Neo4jSchemaInitializer` runs an idempotent Cypher statement at every startup
(`CREATE CONSTRAINT ... IF NOT EXISTS`) to ensure `Destination.id` is unique.
This is a deliberate choice for a single node type with a single, simple
constraint; it should be reconsidered if the graph model grows (multiple
node types, relationships, ordered/versioned schema changes).

## Assumed debt: Neo4j Community Edition access control

Unlike identity-service and payment-service, which each connect to Postgres
with a dedicated application account with limited rights, this service
connects to Neo4j using the single administrative account (`neo4j`).
Neo4j Community Edition has no RBAC and no multi-tenant user support: there
is exactly one administrative account, and no way to provision a scoped,
per-service account. This is a known, documented limitation of the edition,
not an oversight — see the Javadoc on `Neo4jConnectionConfig` for the full
rationale.

## Configuration

All connection values are externalized via environment variables in
`application.yml` (`NEO4J_HOST`, `NEO4J_PORT`, `NEO4J_USERNAME`,
`NEO4J_PASSWORD`, `SERVER_PORT`). There is no `dbname` variable: Neo4j
Community Edition has a single default database. The service fails fast at
startup if any required variable is absent.

## Not yet implemented

- No second node type (e.g. no `Travel`, `Activity`, `Accommodation`).
- No pathfinding / multi-hop traversal — only the one-hop `TRANSPORT` query
  above.
- No update/delete on `TRANSPORT` relationships, no anti-duplicate
  protection (see above).
- No `/internal/*` cross-service endpoints.
