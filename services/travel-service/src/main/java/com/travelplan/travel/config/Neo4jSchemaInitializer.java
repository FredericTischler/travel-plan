/**
 * Ensures the {@code Destination.id} uniqueness constraint exists at startup.
 *
 * No Flyway / neo4j-migrations tool is used here: for a single node type with
 * a single, simple constraint, an idempotent Cypher statement run once at
 * boot is simpler than introducing a dedicated migration tool and its own
 * bookkeeping (schema history node, checksum tracking, etc.). Reconsider this
 * choice if the graph model grows (multiple node types, relationships,
 * ordered/versioned schema changes).
 *
 * {@code CREATE CONSTRAINT ... IF NOT EXISTS} is idempotent: safe to run on
 * every startup, including against an already-initialised database.
 *
 * Same constraint is applied to {@code Activity.id} and
 * {@code Accommodation.id}: both are application-assigned UUIDs (see their
 * respective entity Javadoc), so uniqueness is not guaranteed by Neo4j
 * itself unless declared.
 *
 * <p>{@code IF NOT EXISTS} is idempotent at the level of the final schema
 * state, but not at the level of a single execution: when two instances of
 * this application start concurrently against the same, not-yet-initialised
 * database (e.g. two Kubernetes replicas or two Docker Compose replicas
 * coming up together), both may try to create the same constraint at the
 * same time. Neo4j's Forseti locking can then detect a deadlock between the
 * two schema transactions and abort one of them with a
 * {@code Neo.TransientError.Transaction.DeadlockDetected}, surfaced here as
 * a {@link TransientDataAccessException} (the Spring Data Neo4j translation
 * of the driver's {@code TransientException}). That failure is transient by
 * definition: retrying the same statement shortly after succeeds once the
 * other instance's transaction has committed. Each constraint statement is
 * therefore retried a bounded number of times with a short fixed backoff.
 * Any other exception (invalid Cypher, an actually unreachable database,
 * etc.) is not transient and is left to fail startup immediately, as
 * before.</p>
